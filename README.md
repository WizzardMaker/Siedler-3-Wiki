# Welcome to the Settlers III Wiki!

This is a work-in-progress wiki aiming to provide detailed information to non-german players of The Settlers IV. By now, the game is pretty thoroughly researched, but the information was almost entirely in german up until now. Once the wiki is fully translated, we hope that international players can benefit from that knowledge as well.

Currently, this wiki is directly based on it's [german counterpart](/de/S3/). As such, you may find that some pages haven't been translated yet or link to documents / videos that are in german. This may be adressed in the future. Until then, if you are interested in learning more, the Settlers Community will usually share their knowledge. One of the easiest ways to get in touch is to join the [Settlers United Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/N22X3QDxMu).
