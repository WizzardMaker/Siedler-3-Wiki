## In general
With 12% kk you get an average of 0.8% per gold bar. With 51% kk you get an average of 0.4% per gold bar. With 63% kk you get an average of 0.2% per gold bar. With 76% kk you get an average of 0.1% per gold bar. With 88% kk you get an average of 0.05% per gold bar. From now on it stays at 0.05% ad infinitum. Egyptians get half as much kk per gold bar but twice as much for gemstones.

Since the damage values are relatively low and the calculations are not based on odd numbers, some quite unexpected results have emerged. Here are a few examples:

* A lv. 1 spear with 12% combat power deals the same damage against other spearmen as a lv. 1 spear with up to 87.4%. From 85.5%, the lv. 1 spear deals double damage &#x20;
* If 70% is exceeded, the lv. 2 spears are just as strong as enemy lv. 2 spears with 100%. (As long as spear is fought against spear)
* &#x20;If 92.9% is exceeded, the lv. 3 arches and spears are just as strong as with 100%.
* &#x20;When 108.3% is exceeded, the lv. 3 bows and spears have a significant advantage over the native units &#x20;
* On a 1 vs. 1 map with 50% combat power, lv. 2 spears are initially stronger than swords &#x20;
* Lv. 2 arches have the same damage as lv. 3 arches against spears in your own country.
