Damage changes due to miracles are calculated according to the combat power and armor calculation. Odd numbers are rounded down again. (Example: A lv. 1 swordsman with 65% combat power or 7 damage is enchanted with the miracle Endure Attacker. Now it only deals 1 damage against spear fighters. The 7 damage is first reduced to 3 by the armor bonus. Then the miracle halves the attack again and rounds it down to 1.)_
