Each spell has an area of effect (AoE), which can be imagined as a circle with a radius. As shown in the illustration below, the effect of spells such as The Samurai Sword and Ch'ih-Yu's Shield reaches a radius of 9 squares &#x20;

For all spells, there are only nine unique radii for AoEs [→ 6; 7; 8; 9; 16; 18; 24; 32; ∞] and priests can cast spells over 24 tiles or, for some spells, over the entire map. The effects always spread from the center of the AoE, and with some exceptions, the effects do not stack despite the mana cost if the spells are cast multiple times in quick succession;

To get an idea of the size of AoEs in the game, it is useful to know that a small tower reaches a radius of 32 tiles and an archer on the ground has a range of 15 tiles.
